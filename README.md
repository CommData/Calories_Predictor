# Calories Burnt Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to predict calories burnt during exercise, leveraging a web interface built with Streamlit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Required packages:
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle
warnings
streamlit
Install these packages using pip:

``` bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn pickle warnings streamlit
```
### Running the Project

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calories-burnt-prediction.git
cd calories-burnt-prediction
streamlit run streamlit.py
```
In the web interface, select your gender and provide the following information:

Age (years)
Height (cm)
Weight (kg)
Duration of exercise (minutes)
Average heart rate (beats per minute)
Average body temperature (Celsius)
Click the "Calculate the calories burnt during exercise" button to see the prediction.

## Data

X_train, X_test: These datasets contain the features used for training and testing the model (e.g., gender, age, height, etc.).
TrainedModel.sav: The serialized machine learning model.
